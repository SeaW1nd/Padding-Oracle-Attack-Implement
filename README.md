# Padding-Oracle-Attack-Implement
My Little project that heavily inspired by a challenge for a challenges in my CTF club, which was a crypto challenge that using padding oracle attack method on AES CBC.
# How to use:
Use `python3 exploit.py` and input your message so that the AES algorithm will encrypt your message with CBC mode </br>
Then the script will using my own algorithm to implement Padding Oracle Attack on AES algorithm to decrypt the ciphertext into your own message </br>
I also have the check function to check if my decrypted message is the same as the original message or not (which is your input) </br>
Here is an example of how to use my script:
